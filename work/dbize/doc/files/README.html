<div class="description"><h1><a href="../classes/DBize.html">DBize</a></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/DBize.html">DBize</a> is a mixin to allow objects to be
easily stored and retrieved from a database.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
To install simply unpack the gzipped tarball into your local site_ruby
path. This path is usually +/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.6/+. An install
script is not currently provided.
</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>
Presently <a href="../classes/DBize.html">DBize</a> may be resricted to use
with PostgreSQL, since <a href="../classes/DBize.html">DBize</a> depends on
the use of sequences in the form of: <em>{table}_{attribute}_seq</em> when
instering records. This will be corrected in the future.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
Ruby 1.6.7+ DBI 1.26+ DBD
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Your object will require a new method called <em>table</em> which returns
the name of the table that stores the object type. it will also need
methods <em>record</em> and <em>record=</em> to store the current
&quot;id&quot; of a record.
</p>
<p>
After this, simply mixin a class with include <a
href="../classes/DBize/Record.html">DBize::Record</a>. Doing so will give
your object some new methods such as <a
href="../classes/DBize/Record.html#M000016">insert_into_database</a> and <a
href="../classes/DBize/Record.html#M000014">load_from_database</a>.
</p>
<p>
The key to <a href="../classes/DBize.html">DBize</a>'s automatic ability is
the use of the database attribute (field) names as method calls to the
mixed object. Thus your object needs to have <em>attribute&lt;i&gt; and
&lt;i&gt;attribute=</em> methods defined for the fields you wish to be
soted into the table. <a href="../classes/DBize.html">DBize</a> will ignore
unused fields, so you don't necessarily need to cover every databse
attribute and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to the rdocs, to understand this better.
