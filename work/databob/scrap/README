= DBize

== Introduction

DBize is a mixin to allow objects
to be easily stored and retrieved from a database.

== Installation

To install simply unpack the gzipped tarball into your local site_ruby path.
This path is usually +/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.6/+.
An install script is not currently provided.

== Current Limitations

Presently DBize may be resricted to use with PostgreSQL,
since DBize depends on the use of sequences in the form of:
<i>{table}_{attribute}_seq</i> when instering records.
This will be corrected in the future.

== Requirements

Ruby 1.6.7+
DBI 1.26+
DBD

== Usage

Your object will require a new method called <i>table</i>
which returns the name of the table that stores the object type.
it will also need methods <i>record</i> and <i>record=</i> to 
store the current "id" of a record.

After this, simply mixin a class with include DBize::Record.
Doing so will give your object some new methods such as
insert_into_database and load_from_database.

The key to DBize's automatic ability is the use of the
database attribute (field) names as method calls to the mixed object.
Thus your object needs to have <i>attribute<i> and <i>attribute=</i>
methods defined for the fields you wish to be soted into the table.
DBize will ignore unused fields, so you don't necessarily need to cover
every databse attribute and vice-versa.

Please refer to the rdocs, to understand this better.
