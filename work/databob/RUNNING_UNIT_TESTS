== Creating the test database

The default name for the test database is "activerecord_unittest". If you want 
to use another database name then be sure to update the connection adapter 
setups you want to test with in connections/. When you have the database online,
you can import the fixture tables with the fixtures/db_definitions/*.sql files.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all the adapters. You can also run the suite on just
one adapter by using the tasks test_mysql_ruby, test_ruby_mysql, test_sqlite, 
or test_postresql. For more information, checkout the full array of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running by hand

If you only want to run a single test suite, or don't want to bother with Rake,
you can do so with something like:

   ruby -I "connections/native_mysql" base_test.rb
   
That'll run the base suite using the MySQL-Ruby adapter. Change the adapter
and test suite name as needed.

You can also run all the suites on a specific adapter with:

   ./all.sh "connections/native_mysql"
