# Fixtures are a way of organizing data that you want to test against. Each fixture file is created as a row
# in the database and created as a hash with column names as keys and data as values. All of these fixture hashes
# are kept in an overall hash where they can be accessed by their file name.
#
# Example:
#
# Directory with the fixture files
#
#   developers/
#     david
#     luke
#     jamis
#
# The file +david+ then contains:
#
#   id => 1
#   name => David Heinemeier Hansson
#   birthday => 1979-10-15
#   profession => Systems development
#
# Now when we call <tt>@developers = Fixtures.new(ActiveRecord::Base.connection, "developers", "developers/")</tt> all three
# developers will get inserted into the "developers" table through the active Active Record connection (that must be setup
# before-hand). And we can now query the fixture data through the <tt>@developers</tt> hash, so <tt>@developers["david"]["name"]</tt>
# will return <tt>"David Heinemeier Hansson"</tt> and <tt>@developers["david"]["birthday"]</tt> will return <tt>Date.new(1979, 10, 15)</tt>.
#
# This can then be used for comparison in a unit test. Something like:
#
#   def test_find
#     assert_equal @developers["david"]["name"], Developer.find(@developers["david"]["id"]).name
#   end
