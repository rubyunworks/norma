*0.1*

* Organized all require dependencies into abstract_adapater.rb 
  --a couple were out of place anyway.

* Made modification so that adapters no longer need a *_connection
  method. Instead adapters simply add a hash reference in the
  ConnectionAdapters::Available module constant.

* Moved connection thread code to DatabaseConnection module.
  I'm assuming that won't be a problem.
  
* Created Active Adapter from Active Record's adapter code.
